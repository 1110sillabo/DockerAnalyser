## What is Docker Finder ?
Docker Finder is a tool enabling a more powerful search of Docker images with
respect to the tools currently provided by the Docker platform (**docker search**, **Docker Hub**).

The main steps performed by Docker Finder are the following

1. Download Docker images from the Docker Hub,
2. generate and store a new description of the images into a local storage,
and
3. search the images by looking into the Docker Finder description storage.
